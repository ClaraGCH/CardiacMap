Each excel file represents a wild-type E9.5 embryo containing all the cells within the DPW. Within the files each row is a cell and each columns is a measurement. 
The measurements have been obtained from:
- Tissue analyser :  https://github.com/baigouy/tissue_analyzer/tree/main (Aigouy et al. 2016)
- Force inference : https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/78ng4tmj75/4 (Kong et al.2019)
- Dproj : https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/iah-public/DeProj (Herbert et al. 2021)

The dataset is composed by:
- 6 excel files corresponding to the measurements of the 6 Wild-type E9.5 embryos --> E9WTDPWgolgi_measuremetsbyTA&FI&Dproj_E[i].xlsx
- 6 excel files containing only the Tbx5+ cells for each embryo -->e[i]clone_tbx5+.xlsx
- The ready to use dataset containng all the cells from the 6 embryos --> E9WT_forcalssification.csv
