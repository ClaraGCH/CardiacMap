### Goal: 
Understand the patterning of cardiac progenitors.The embryonic heart grows by the progressive addition of progenitor cells located on an epithelial layer known as the Dorsal pericardial wall (DPW).
T-box transcription genes (Tbx1 and Tbx5) play a key role in regulating the addition of the cells to the poles of the heart. However, the mechanisms by which the cells contribute to each pole remain unclear.

### To investigate this, we have:
1. Employed unsupervised clustering algorythms to map the cells according to their morphological features.
2. Applied supervised classification algorythms to predict whether a cell will express Tbx5 gene.
