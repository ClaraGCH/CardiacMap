### Goal: 
Understand the patterning of cardiac progenitors.
The embryonic heart grows by the progressive addition of progenitor cells that lie on a epithelial layer called the Dorsal pericardial wall (DPW).
T-box transcription genes (Tbx1 and Tbx5) are the main regulator of the addition of the cells to the poles.We do not understand the mechanisms by which the cells decide to contribute to each pole of the heart.

### To investigate this we have:
1. Used Unsupervised clustering algorythms to map the cells according to their morphological features.
2. Used Supervised classification algorythms to predict if a cell will express Tbx5 gene.
