# CardiacCells_Characterisation

### Goal: 
Understand the patterning of cardiac progenitors.
The embryonic heart grows by the progressive addition of progenitor cells that lie on a epithelial layer called the Dorsal pericardial wall (DPW).
T-box transcription genes (Tbx1 and Tbx5) are the main regulator of the addition of the cells to the poles.

### Gap in the field: 
We do not understand the mechanisms by which the cells decide to contribute to each pole of the heart.

### To investigate this we have:
1. Used Unsupervised clustering algorythms to map the cells according to their morphological features.
2. Used Supervised classification algorythms to predict if a cell will express Tbx5 gene.
3. Used image classification algorythms to predict if an embryo will be healthy or mutant for a T-box gene.
